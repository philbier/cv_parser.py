# CV Parser
A proof-of-concept using mthod from Natural Language Processing (NLP) in order to extract skills from CVs.

## Introduction
Consultancies’ main business is delivering projects that create value for clients. To ensure this, sales staff needs to find consultants with the right set of skills. Usually they go through a manual process of screening consultant profiles (CVs) in Word or PDF format and match these with client’s requirements. If the right CV is not at hand or not up-to-date, sales staff often reaches out to colleagues or their external network directly. This is a time-consuming process that results in more people getting involved than necessary and therefore presents an opportunity for automation.
