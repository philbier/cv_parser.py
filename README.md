## Introduction

## How to use 

## Prereqs

- [**Node.js**][node]: You'll need Node.js version 8.0 or higher. A GitHub Action runs tests on all major Node versions on every commit. One caveat for Node 8, if you get a `Parse Error` with `code: HPE_HEADER_OVERFLOW` you're out of luck and you'll need to upgrade to Node 10+.
- **npm**: usually comes with Node.js, type `npm` in your terminal to check for its presence
- [**ffmpeg**][ffmpeg]: a recent version (year 2019 or above), in `$PATH` or in the same directory as this README file (project root).
- [**git**][git]: one or more npm dependencies require git.

Destreamer takes a [honeybadger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4r7wHMg5Yjg) approach towards the OS it's running on. We've successfully tested it on Windows, macOS and Linux.
